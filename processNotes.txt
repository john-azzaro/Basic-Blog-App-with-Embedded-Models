Basic Blog App with Embedded Models notes
=========================================




Objective
=========
    In this application study, we'll make a blog application with Crud Operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) 
    functionality with mongoose and add additional embedded models functionality to it. I'm going to go step-by-step
    through the process of createing a blog application with the additional features of embedded models for the 
    applications. 
        
    If you would like to see a more in-depth process of the phases before the addition of the embedded 
    models, see Basic-Blog-App here: https://github.com/john-azzaro/Basic-Blog-App . Note thatI'm using this current
    application to repeat and internalize the process for study purposes, so this may be a bit repetitive so please skip
    down to the embedded models section if you are familiar with the orginal basic-blog-app.
